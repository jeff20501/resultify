## Overview
This project is a Results Summary Component, inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. The component displays a user's test score summary, dynamically rendered from a JSON data file.

The layout is clean and modern, with a gradient-based score section and a summary table that visually highlights different categories using distinct colors.

### The challenge

1Ô∏è‚É£ Rendering JSON data dynamically to the table
The challenge was fetching and iterating through JSON data, then injecting it as table rows into the DOM.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Applying different colors to each category dynamically
Solved by using conditional logic in JavaScript to assign inline colors directly based on the category value.

## My process

### Built with

HTML5: Markup structure

CSS3: Styling (gradients, flexbox, responsive design, custom fonts)

JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, dynamic rendering of data

JSON: Data source for categories and scores

Google Fonts: Custom fonts (Hanken Grotesk, Poppins)

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```

### Continued development

Add form submission to collect actual user data and calculate real-time results

Integrate a backend API to store or retrieve scores

Add animations or transitions on score load

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

Implement tests (unit or UI) to ensure reliability
